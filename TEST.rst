HMS Endeavour
=============
Summary
-------
*HMS Endeavour*, also known as *HM Bark Endeavour*, was a `British Royal Navy
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Navy>`_ research vessel commanded 
by Lieutenant `James Cook <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook>`_ on his
first voyage of discovery, to `Australia <http://en.wikipedia.org
/wiki/Australia>`_ and `New Zealand <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
New_Zealand>`_ from 1769 to 1771.

*Construction Endeavour* was originally a merchant collier named 
`Earl of Pembroke <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Pembroke>`_, 
launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of `Whitby 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitby>`_ in `North Yorkshire 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Yorkshire>`_, and as such 
is known locally as the Whitby Cat. She was ship-rigged and sturdily built 
with a broad, flat bow, a square stern and a long box-like body with a 
deep hold. Her length was 106 feet (32 m), and 97 feet 7 inches (29.74 m) on 
her lower deck, with a beam of 29 feet 3 inches (8.92 m). Her burthen was 
368 71/94 tons.

Voyage of discovery, the first voyage of `James Cook 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook>`_ was a combined 
`Royal Navy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy>`_ and 
`Royal Society <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society>`_ expedition to 
the `South Pacific Ocean <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific_Ocean>`_ 
aboard HMS Endeavour, from 1768 to 1771. The aims of the expedition were 
to observe the 1769 transit of `Venus <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus>`_ 
across the `Sun <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun>`_, and to seek evidence 
of the postulated `Terra Australis Incognita <http://en.wikiped
ia.org/wiki/Terra_Australis_Incognita>`_ or "unknown southern land". The 
voyage was commissioned by `King George III <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
King_George_III>`_ and commanded by Lieutenant `James Cook 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook>`_, a junior naval officer with 
skills in `cartography <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography>`_ and 
`mathematics <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics>`_. 
Departing `Plymouth <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth>`_ in August 1768, 
the expedition crossed the `Atlantic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic>`_, 
rounded `Cape Horn <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Horn>`_ and reached 
`Tahiti <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti>`_ in time to observe the 
transit of `Venus <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus>`_. `Cook 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook>`_ then set sail into the largely 
uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the pacific islands of `Huahine 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huahine>`_, `Borabora <http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Borabora>`_ and `Raiatea <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiatea>`_ 
to claim them for `Great Britain <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_
Britain>`_ [1]_, and unsuccessfully attempting to land at `Rurutu <http://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/Rurutu>`_. In September 1769, the expedition reached 
`New Zealand <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand>`_, being the second 
`Europeans <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europeans>`_ to visit there, following 
its earlier discovery by `Abel Tasman <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Abel_Tasman>`_ 127 years earlier. `Cook <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Co
ok>`_ and his crew spent the following six months charting the `New Zealand 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand>`_ coast, before resuming their voyage 
westward across open sea. In April 1770, they became the first `Europeans 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europeans>`_ to reach the east coast of 
`Australia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia>`_, making landfall on the 
shore of what is now known as `Botany Bay <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bot
any_Bay>`_. The expedition continued northward along the Australian coastline, 
narrowly avoiding shipwreck on the `Great Barrier Reef <http://en.wikiped
ia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef>`_. In October 1770, the badly damaged 
`Endeavour <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endeavour>`_ came into a port 
in `Batavia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta>`_ in the `Dutch East 
Indies <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies>`_, her crew sworn to 
secrecy about the lands they had discovered. They resumed their journey on 26 
December, rounded the `Cape of Good Hope <http://en.wikipedia.org/wi
ki/Cape_of_Good_Hope>`_ on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of 
`Deal <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal,_Kent>`_ on 12 July. The voyage 
lasted almost three years.
