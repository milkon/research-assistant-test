HMS Endeavour

Summary
HMS Endeavour, also known as HM Bark Endeavour, was a British Royal Navy 
research vessel commanded by Lieutenant James Cook on his first voyage of 
discovery, to Australia and New Zealand from 1769 to 1771.

Construction
Endeavour was originally a merchant collier named Earl of Pembroke, launched
in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of Whitby in North Yorkshire, 
and as such is known locally as the Whitby Cat. She was ship-rigged and 
sturdily built with a broad, flat bow, a square stern and a long box-like body
with a deep hold. Her length was 106 feet (32 m), and 97 feet 7 inches 
(29.74 m) on her lower deck, with a beam of 29 feet 3 inches (8.92 m).
Her burthen was 368 71/94 tons.

Voyage of discovery
The first voyage of James Cook was a combined Royal Navy and Royal Society 
expedition to the south Pacific ocean aboard HMS Endeavour, from 1768 to 1771. 
The aims of the expedition were to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across 
the Sun, and to seek evidence of the postulated Terra Australis Incognita or
"unknown southern land".
The voyage was commissioned by King George III and commanded by Lieutenant 
James Cook, a junior naval officer with skills in cartography and mathematics. 
Departing Plymouth in August 1768, the expedition crossed the Atlantic, 
rounded Cape Horn and reached Tahiti in time to observe the transit of Venus. 
Cook then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at 
the Pacific islands of Huahine, Borabora and Raiatea to claim them for Great 
Britain[citation needed], and unsuccessfully attempting to land at Rurutu. In 
September 1769, the expedition reached New Zealand, being the second Europeans 
to visit there, following its earlier discovery by Abel Tasman 127 years 
earlier. Cook and his crew spent the following six months charting the New 
Zealand coast, before resuming their voyage westward across open sea. In April 
1770, they became the first Europeans to reach the east coast of Australia,
making landfall on the shore of what is now known as Botany Bay.
The expedition continued northward along the Australian coastline, narrowly 
avoiding shipwreck on the Great Barrier Reef. In October 1770, the badly 
damaged Endeavour came into a port in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, her 
crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had discovered. They resumed their 
journey on 26 December, rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771, and 
reached the English port of Deal on 12 July. The voyage lasted almost three 
years.
