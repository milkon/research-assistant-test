How to do it?
=============

1. Find the file TEST.rst in this repository. It is a plain text file.
2. Reformat it using ReStructuredText markup rules, so that:
    
   1. Text has the correct header and sub-headers
   2. Each name of the vessel is *italized*
   3. Each proper name, except vessel names, is a link to a corresponding 
      `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia>`_ article
   4. No line occupies more that 80 characters 

3. Create a Dropbox folder containing only the resulting file 
4. Share the folder with me, using either my personal or work email address
   (find them)

.. tip::
   This file is itself written in reStructuredText format (click 'raw' to 
   see the source) and contains almost everything you need to know in order 
   to complete the task. Although further research is welcome.

.. tip::
   You may try to find an online reStructuredText editor to help you with 
   editing/testing

.. note::
   Apparently this is the common problem, so please note: reStructuredText is 
   a plain-text format, that you could (and should) edit in a simple text 
   editor, such as Notepad. Don't rely on any specialized editor too much.
